Place a small saucepan over medium heat, add in the milk and heat until just warm (don't simmer or boil). Alternatively, this can be done in the microwave in bursts. To be specific, heat the milk to 40°c or 104°f. , 2. In a large mixing bowl, add the yeast, the tsp of the caster of fine sugar that's been separated and pour over the warmed milk. Whisk together until combined and allow to sit for 10 minutes or until the mixture starts to bubble and foam on top (if this doesn't work, it means your yeast has died. This only happens if it's old or you have heated the milk too much)., 3.

Add in the kneaded dough, place over a warm damp tea towel and allow this to proof for 1 hour in a warmish area. , 6.

Give it a few punches to knock out the air and knead for 30 seconds to ensure there are no air pockets. Roll the dough into a 60cm or 23-inch log, slice it in half and roll both logs into 40cm or 15 inches. Slice each log into 6 even-sized pieces which will leave you 12 even-sized dough pieces. To be exact, you can weigh each dough ball to ensure they're all the same size. Roll into neat smooth balls.   , 7. Spray with oil and line a 9x13 inch deep-sided baking dish with parchment paper. Place in the dough balls, 3 across and 4 down. Place over some lightly oiled cling wrap or plastic wrap and let proof for 40 minutes or until risen by 70%. , 8. Preheat oven to 180°c -350°f., 9. To make the crosses, add the bread flour and cold water to a mixing bowl and whisk together until it forms a smooth paste.

In the meantime to make the sugar syrup glaze, in a bowl add the caster (fine) sugar and boiling water and mix to combine using a pastry brush. , 12.

While the wings cook, add the butter and hot sauce to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat until the butter has melted, whisking occasionally. Set aside. Alternatively, place the butter and hot sauce in a cast iron or high-heat-safe saucepan and place it in the BBQ to achieve a smoky sauce. If doing this, only heat for a few minutes until the butter has melted and whisk well., 5. Combine all ingredients in a bowl for the blue cheese sauce. Store in the fridge until ready to serve., 6. <div class=""wprm-recipe-instruction-text"" style=""margin-bottom: 5px;""><span style=""display: block;"">Remove the wings from the grill and place them in a bowl.
